-- arch/arm64/patches

Cobalt needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the interrupt pipeline (aka I-pipe) in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
source tree as published by kernel.org.

You may want to have a look at
http://xenomai.org/installing-xenomai-3-x/ for detailed information
about installing Xenomai.

The Cobalt/arm64 port is work in progress. The I-pipe support for this
architecture is exclusively available from this development tree at
the moment:

git://git.xenomai.org/ipipe.git, branch devel/ipipe-3.18-linaro-arm64.
