-- arch/arm64/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the interrupt pipeline (aka I-pipe) in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
tree, before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the
latter kernel.

The Xenomai arm64 port is work in progress. The I-pipe support for
this architecture is exclusively available from this development tree
at the moment:

git://git.xenomai.org/ipipe.git, branch devel/ipipe-3.18-linaro-arm64.
