-- arch/blackfin/patches

Cobalt needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the interrupt pipeline (aka I-pipe) in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
source tree as published by kernel.org.

This directory only contains the most recent patches for Blackfin
platforms at the time of the release; you may find the complete
collection of I-pipe patches issued for this architecture at the
